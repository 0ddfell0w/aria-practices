  </p>
  <p>
    Following are three example implementations of the
    <a href="../../#grid">design pattern for grid</a>
    that demonstrate how a grid can be used to group a collection of interactive widgets into a single stop in the page tab sequence. 
    In these examples, each widget, such as a link or button,  is in a separate cell of the grid, and the user can navigate among them with the arrow keys.
    While navigating with the arrow keys, widgets receive keyboard focus and can be activated with <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to streamlining keyboard interfaces, these grids also provide the groups of widgets they contain with a logical structure that can be easily understood by screen reader users.
    Because screen readers present grids using their broadly familiar table constructs, screen reader users can perceive the logical relationships conveyed by the visual arrangement of the widgets in these examples.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, one of the most important reasons for using a grid widget as a grouping container for other widgets is that grid cells are structures that do not override or suppress the semantics of the elements they contain.
    That is, a link contained inside of a grid cell is presented to a screen reader as a link whereas a link inside of a <code>menu</code> must be a <code>menuitem</code> and a link inside of a <code>listbox</code> must be an <code>option</code>.
    These examples are designed to demonstrate some of the wide variety of circumstances, ranging from very simple to moderately complex, where it is advantageous to leverage this important feature of grids.

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <section>
      <h3 id="ex1_label">Example 1: Simple List of Links</h3>
      <div aria-labelledby="ex1_label" role="region">
        <div id="ex1"></div>
      </div>
      <p>In this implementation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Links can be focused using standard navigation keys, including directional arrows, <kbd>Home</kbd>,
          <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Control + Home</kbd>, and <kbd>Control + End</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <kbd>Page Down</kbd> and <kbd>Page Up</kbd> keys are not supported since such
          scroll-like functions are not useful with so few rows.
        </li>
        <li>The links can be activated with the keyboard when focused.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="ex2_label">Example 2: Pill List For Components Like a List of Message Recipients</h3>
      <div aria-labelledby="ex2_label" role="region">
        <div id="ex2"></div>
      </div>
      <p>In this implementation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The navigation keys and functions are the same as example 1.</li>
        <li>Since text inputs require arrow keys to operate, the implementation and user
          experience are simplified by placing the input outside the grid.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="ex3_label">Example 3: Scrollable Search Results</h3>
      <div aria-labelledby="ex3_label" role="region">
        <div id="ex3"></div>
      </div>
      <p>In this implementation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In addition to the navigation keys supported in examples 1 and 2, <kbd>Page Down</kbd> and
          <kbd>Page Up</kbd> can scroll the grid.
        </li>
        <li>
          As navigating up or down scrolls the visible set of rows, the <code>aria-rowindex</code>
          value of the row containing the focus informs the screen reader of the number of that row
          within the total set of rows.
        </li>
      </ul>
