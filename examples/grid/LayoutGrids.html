  </p>
  <p>
    Following are three example implementations of the
    <a href="../../#grid">design pattern for grid</a>
    that demonstrate how a grid can be used to group a collection of interactive widgets into a single stop in the page tab sequence. 
    In these examples, each widget, such as a link or button,  is in a separate cell of the grid, and the user can navigate among them with the arrow keys.
    While navigating with the arrow keys, widgets receive keyboard focus and can be activated with <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to streamlining keyboard interfaces, these grids also provide the groups of widgets they contain with a logical structure that can be easily understood by screen reader users.
    Because screen readers present grids using their broadly familiar table constructs, screen reader users can perceive the logical relationships conveyed by the visual arrangement of the widgets in these examples.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, one of the most important reasons for using a grid widget as a grouping container for other widgets is that grid cells are structures that do not override or suppress the semantics of the elements they contain.
    That is, a link contained inside of a grid cell is presented to a screen reader as a link whereas a link inside of a <code>menu</code> must be a <code>menuitem</code> and a link inside of a <code>listbox</code> must be an <code>option</code>.
    These examples are designed to demonstrate some of the wide variety of circumstances, ranging from very simple to moderately complex, where it is advantageous to leverage this important feature of grids.

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <section>
      <h3 id="ex1_label">Example 1: Simple List of Links</h3>
      <p>This example presents a list of links titled &quot;Related Documents&quot; in a grid. </p>
      <div aria-labelledby="ex1_label" role="region">
        <div id="ex1">
          <!-- 
            @Tatiana: this is the group of links I would like to reflow into multiple columns, like a table, based on window or screen width.
            The point is to demo a grid that restructures itself based on how CSS is filling the screen.
            We could have the user resize the browser window to see the effect unless you think there is a better way to show the user the effect.  
            However, the end game is to make the grid structure dependent on what the css does, ie, the css determines the number of columns.
          -->
          <h4 id="grid1_label">Related Documents</h4>
          <div role="grid" aria-labelledby="grid1_label">
            <div role="row">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>In this implementation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          This grid dynamically restructures itself based on screen size. 
          As the grid structure changes, the arrow key behavior adjusts accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since all the links are part of a single logical group, repeatedly pressing either the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> or <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key will move focus from the first link to the last link, 
          but in different sequences that depend on the visual arrangement.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> keys reverse <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd focus movement, respectively.> 
        </li>
        <li>
          The <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> keys will move focus to the first and last links, respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <kbd>Page Down</kbd> and <kbd>Page Up</kbd> keys are not supported since 
          scrolling or row skipping functions are not needed with so few rows.
        </li>
        <li>The links can be activated with the keyboard when focused.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3 id="ex2_label">Example 2: Pill List For Components Like a List of Message Recipients</h3>
      <p>Type a string in the &quot;Add Recipient&quot; field and press enter or activate the &quot;Add&quot; button to see how this grid behaves as the number of elements increases. <div aria-labelledby="ex2_label" role="region">
        <div id="ex2">
          <!-- 
            @Tatiana: The user should be able to type a string in the input and either press enter or activate the add button and a row gets added to the grid.
            The IDs provided in the following are just to demo the labeling; I assume most will be dynamically generated.
            This should be styled so it is presented like a e-mail "To" field and wrap to new lines as it grows; tokens on a line will not necessarily align with tokens on a previous or following line.
            I am assuming the remove icon buttons will be the typical X icon; I just put a letter X in the span as a placeholder.
           -->
          <span id="send_to_label">Send To:</span>
          <div role="grid" aria-labelledby="send_to_label">
            <div role="row">
              <span role="gridcell"><a id="r1" tabindex="-1" href="#">Recipient Name 1</a></span>
              <span role="gridcell"><span id="rb1" tabindex="-1" role="button" aria-label="Remove" aria-labelledby="rb1 r1"> X </span></span>
            </div>
            <div role="row">
              <span role="gridcell"><a id="r2" tabindex="-1" href="#">Recipient Name 2</a></span>
              <span role="gridcell"><span id="rb2" tabindex="-1" role="button" aria-label="Remove" aria-labelledby="rb2 r2"> X </span></span>
            </div>
          </div>        
          <input type="text" aria-label="Add Recipient" placeholder="New Recipient Name">
          <button>Add</</button>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>In this implementation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>As the number of recipients grows, the new elements wrap on to additional lines as needed.</li>
        <li>Like in example 1, Keyboard users can navigate through every element from beginning to end with the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key and vice versa with the <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> key. </li>
        <li>However, since elements are not vertically aligned, <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> moves to the next logical row instead of to the next visual row. In this case, each row has two cells -- one with the recipient name and one with the remove icon (button) for that name. </li>
        <li>
          Since text inputs require arrow keys to operate, the implementation and user
            experience are simplified by logically placing the input outside the grid.
            That is, while the input field appears to be part of the structure, it is not a child of the grid element, and thus has its own place in the tab sequence.
          </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="ex3_label">Example 3: Scrollable Search Results</h3>
      <p>
        This example demonstrates how a grid can make moving through an infinitely large data set as easy and efficient for keyboard users as it is for people using a mouse.
      </p>
      <div aria-labelledby="ex3_label" role="region">
        <div id="ex3"></div>
      </div>
      <p>In this implementation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In addition to the navigation keys supported in examples 1 and 2, <kbd>Page Down</kbd> and
          <kbd>Page Up</kbd> can scroll the grid.
        </li>
        <li>
          As navigating up or down scrolls the visible set of rows, the <code>aria-rowindex</code>
          value of the row containing the focus informs the screen reader of the number of that row
          within the total set of rows.
        </li>
      </ol>
