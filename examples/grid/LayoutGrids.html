  <p>
    Following are three example implementations of the
    <a href="../../#grid">design pattern for grid</a>
    that demonstrate how a grid can be used to group a collection of interactive widgets into a single stop in the page tab sequence.
    In these examples, each widget, such as a link or button,  is in a separate cell of the grid, and the user can navigate among them with the arrow keys.
    While navigating with the arrow keys, widgets receive keyboard focus and can be activated with <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to streamlining keyboard interfaces, these grids also provide the groups of widgets they contain with a logical structure that can be easily understood by screen reader users.
    Because screen readers present grids using their broadly familiar table constructs, screen reader users can perceive the logical relationships conveyed by the visual arrangement of the widgets in these examples.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, one of the most important reasons for using a grid widget as a grouping container for other widgets is that grid cells are structures that do not override or suppress the semantics of the elements they contain.
    That is, a link contained inside of a grid cell is presented to a screen reader as a link whereas a link inside of a <code>menu</code> must be a <code>menuitem</code> and a link inside of a <code>listbox</code> must be an <code>option</code>.
    These examples are designed to demonstrate some of the wide variety of circumstances, ranging from very simple to moderately complex, where it is advantageous to leverage this important feature of grids.

      <h3 id="ex1_label">Example 1: Simple List of Links</h3>
      <p>This example presents a list of links titled &quot;Related Documents&quot; in a grid. </p>
      <div role="separator" id="ex1_start_sep" aria-labelledby="ex1_start_sep ex1_label" aria-label="Start of"></div>
      <div id="ex1">
        <!--
          @Tatiana: this is the group of links I would like to reflow into multiple columns, like a table, based on window or screen width.
          The point is to demo a grid that restructures itself based on how CSS is filling the screen.
          We could have the user resize the browser window to see the effect unless you think there is a better way to show the user the effect.
          However, the end game is to make the grid structure dependent on what the css does, ie, the css determines the number of columns.

      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          This grid dynamically restructures itself based on screen size.
          As the grid structure changes, the arrow key behavior adjusts accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since all the links are part of a single logical group, repeatedly pressing either the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> or <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key will move focus from the first link to the last link,
          but in different sequences that depend on the visual arrangement.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> keys reverse <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd focus movement, respectively.>
        </li>
        <li>
          The <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> keys will move focus to the first and last links, respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <kbd>Page Down</kbd> and <kbd>Page Up</kbd> keys are not supported since
          scrolling or row skipping functions are not needed with so few rows.
        </li>
        <li>The links can be activated with the keyboard when focused.</li>

          @Tatiana: The user should be able to type a string in the input and either press enter or activate the add button and a row gets added to the grid.
          The IDs provided in the following are just to demo the labeling; I assume most will be dynamically generated.
          This should be styled so it is presented like a e-mail "To" field and wrap to new lines as it grows; tokens on a line will not necessarily align with tokens on a previous or following line.
          I am assuming the remove icon buttons will be the typical X icon; I just put a letter X in the span as a placeholder.

      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>As the number of recipients grows, the new elements wrap on to additional lines as needed.</li>
        <li>Like in example 1, Keyboard users can navigate through every element from beginning to end with the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key and vice versa with the <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> key. </li>
        <li>However, <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> move to the next and previous logical rows. In this case, each row has two cells -- one with the recipient name and one with the remove icon (button) for that name. </li>
        <li>
          Since text inputs require arrow keys to operate, the implementation and user
            experience have been simplified by logically placing the input outside the grid.
            That is, while the input field appears to be part of the structure, it is not a child of the grid element, and thus has its own place in the tab sequence.
          </li>
          <li>Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> when focus is in the add recipient input will activate the &quot;Add&quot; button.</li>
          <li>When recipients are added or removed, an off-screen live region informs screen reader users of the result of the action so they do not have to move focus to confirm that the action was completed.</li> 
        </ol>

      <ol>
        <li>
          In addition to the navigation keys supported in examples 1 and 2, <kbd>Page Down</kbd> and
          <kbd>Page Up</kbd> scroll the grid.
        </li>
        <li>
          As navigating up or down scrolls the visible set of rows, the <code>aria-rowindex</code>
          value of the row containing focus informs assistive technologies of the number of that row
          within the total set of rows.

    <h2>Other Features</h2>
    <p>
      The JavaScript for these examples allows the focus movement and wrapping behavior of the arrow keys to be declared in the HTML.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>To make an element focusable, set <code>tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;</code>.
        <ul>
          <li>If a cell container is made focusable, focus will be placed on the cell. Do this when a cell contains static content, such as the abstract of search results in example 3.</li>
          <li>If a cell is not made focusable but an element inside of it is, focus will move to that element. Do this when the cell contains an interactive widget, such as the search result link in example 3.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To declare the arrow key wrapping behavior:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>data-wrap-cols=&quot;true&quot;</code>: Set this value on the grid to make <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> 
          move focus from column to column even across row boundaries to the column (cell) in the next or previous row. 
          Setting it <code>false</code> will disable wrapping. 
          Typically this should be <code>true</code> in all logical layout grids like those on this page 
          and <code>false</code> like those on the 
          <a href="dataGrids.html">data grid examples</a> page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>data-wrap-rows=&quot;true&quot;</code>: Set this value on the grid to make <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> 
          move focus from row to row even across column boundaries to the row (cell) in the next or previous column. 
          Setting it <code>false</code> will disable wrapping. 
          This type of wrapping should only occur when all cells in the grid are logically equivalent.
          That is, the number of cells in a logical unit is one.
          For instance, in example 1, all cells contain a navigation link. 
          The grid contains one set of links that can be presented in a single row, a single column, or divided into two rows of three or three rows of two and remain logically equivalent.
          Conversely, in example 3, each logical row contains three cells, and it would be bizarre for the focus to move from the last search result link to the organization cell of the first search result when <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> is pressed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>: Moves focus one cell to the right.
        When focus is on the right-most cell in the row, focus moves to the first cell in the following row.
        If focus is on the last cell in the grid, focus does not move.
      </li>
      <li>
        <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>: Moves focus one cell to the left.
        When focus is on the left-most cell in the row, focus moves to the last cell in the previous row.
        If focus is on the first cell in the grid, focus does not move.
      </li>
      <li>
        <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>: Moves focus to the next logical row.
        In examples 2 and 3, if focus is in the last logical row, focus does not move.
        In example 1, since there is only one logical row and since all elements are logically equivalent, 
        focus moves to the next cell but does not move if it is in the last cell of the grid.
      </li>
      <li>
        <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>: Moves focus to the previous logical row.
        In examples 2 and 3, if focus is in the first logical row, focus does not move.
        In example 1, since there is only one logical row and since all elements are logically equivalent, 
        focus moves to the previous cell but does not move if it is in the first cell of the grid.
      </li>
      <li>
        <kbd>Page Down</kbd> (Example 3): Moves focus down five rows, 
        scrolling so the bottom row in the currently visible set of rows becomes the first visible row.
        If focus is in the last row, focus does not move.
      </li>
      <li>
        <kbd>Page Up</kbd> (Example 3): Moves focus up 5 rows, 
        scrolling so the top row in the currently visible set of rows becomes the last visible row.
        If focus is in the first row, focus does not move.
      </li>
      <li>
        <kbd>Home</kbd>: moves focus to the first cell in the row that contains focus.
      </li>
      <li>
        <kbd>End</kbd>: moves focus to the last cell in the row that contains focus.
      </li>
      <li><kbd>Control + Home</kbd>: moves focus to the first cell in the first row.</li>
      <li><kbd>Control + End</kbd>: moves focus to the last cell in the last row.</li>

            Conversely, in example 3, each search result is a logical row, but that logical row occupies multiple physical rows on the screen.

            the <code>gridcell</code> element is focusable.
            The JavaScript uses the <code>tabindex</code> attribute to determine where to place focus.

            If a cell contains an interactive widget, such as a link or button, 
            instead of placing the <code>tabindex</code> attribute on the <code>gridcell</code>, it is placed on the widget element.
            The JavaScript uses the <code>tabindex</code> attribute to determine where to place focus.
            Because focus is placed on the widget instead of the cell, assistive technologies can provide the role, state, and property information normally expected for that widget.
            This also makes the widget directly operable for keyboard users.

            In example 3, specified because a total of 19 rows are available, but fewer than 19 rows are visible to assistive technologies.
            In this case, to demonstrate this feature, some rows are hidden using <code>display:none</code>, which excludes them from the browser's accessibility tree.
            a more common scenario for using <code>aria-rowcount</code> is when not all data is loaded into the DOM at one time.

            In example 3, has a value from 1 to 19.
            Because not all rows are present in the accessibility tree, these values override the browser calculation of the row number.
            Note that it is 1-based, not 0-based, and that it is dynamically inserted by the JavaScript.
