    <strong>NOTE:</strong> This is work in progress; it is not ready for review.
    Once ready, feedback will be welcom in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues/100">issue 100</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following three example implementations of the <a href="../../#combobox">design pattern for combobox</a>
    take advantage of implementation options introduced by the ARIA 1.1 specification.
    The intent of the ARIA 1.1 changes are to help assistive technologies render more user friendly presentations and give authors greater design flexibility.
    For example, in addition to allowing listbox as a type of pop-up element, ARIA 1.1 combobox widgets may use a tree, grid, or dialog to present completion values.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Browsers and assistive technologies will continue to support implementations of the <a href="./combobox-aria1.0.html">legacy ARIA 1.0 combobox pattern</a> since it already has wide-spread and successful adoption.
