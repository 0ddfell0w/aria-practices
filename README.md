# ARIA Authoring Practices Guide

Temporary read me to organise the split from the original [ARIA repository](https://github.com/w3c/aria/).

## Some documentation
- Very unclear [GitHub Help page on how to split repo's](https://help.github.com/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository/)
- [How to change GitHub remote's](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/)
- [Issue mover tool](https://github-issue-mover.appspot.com/) to move, err, issues.

## Some questions
- How do we move pull requests?
- Not sure how to move related branches. Seems this is not done through the split method thing.
